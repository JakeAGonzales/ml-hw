## Kernels
In this problem you will implement two kernels: Polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF).
For each one you will:
    1. Search with cross-validation to find optimal parameters
    2. Plot trained function

We recommend implementing functions in order they are provided in a file.
The only exception is that you should also modify `main` function as you keep implementing other functions and solving parts A and B.

After finishing assignment run the code (for example `python homeworks/kernel_bootstrap/main.py`) and in `.pdf` submit plots that you have generated.
